DJANGO-CMS REVOLUTION SLIDER PLUGIN
===================================

A very simple implemetation of Revolution Slider.

It is working!
I will add documentation later.

This plugin provides 2 plugins: 'Slider' and 'Slide'. Simply start by adding a Slider-plugin and then add as many 'Slide'-plugins as you want.
Just like any other plugin, you can change the order of the slides by draggin and dropping them in djangocms's 'structure' mode.
